What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I tell git to start operating in the particular repository and git creates a .git repository to keep track of my commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is somewhere in between the two. Right now I have no idea why the staging area is useful.
